# Overview
The chatbot is built using a Deep Neural Network (DNN) with the help of the TFLearn library. The dataset for training the model is provided in the intents.json file, which contains a list of intents and their respective tags, patterns, and responses. The model uses tokenization, stemming, and bag-of-words techniques to preprocess the data before training the model.
