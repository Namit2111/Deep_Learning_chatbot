# Overview
The chatbot is built using a Deep Neural Network (DNN) with the help of the TFLearn library. The dataset for training the model is provided in the intents.json file, which contains a list of intents and their respective tags, patterns, and responses. The model uses tokenization, stemming, and bag-of-words techniques to preprocess the data before training the model.

# Dependencies

1. nltk library
2. numpy
3. json
4. ensorflow
5. tflearn
6. pickle

# How to use
1. Clone or download the notebook to your local machine.
2. Run the code by the command:
 ```
 python deep_learn_main.py
 ```
3. Make sure all the dependencies are installed.
4. Run the code blocks to train and save the model.
5. Run the chat() function to start chatting with the bot.
Note: You can modify the intents.json file to add your own intents, tags, patterns, and responses.
